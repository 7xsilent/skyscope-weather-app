Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get SkyScope up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Node.js (LTS version recommended)

npm or Yarn package manager

1. Clone the Repository
If your project is in a Git repository, clone it:

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd weather-app # Replace with your project folder name

If you received the files directly, navigate to your project directory.

2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the required packages:

npm install
# OR
yarn install

3. Configure API Keys
SkyScope requires API keys from OpenWeatherMap and Google Gemini.

OpenWeatherMap API Key:

Go to OpenWeatherMap and sign up for a free account.

Generate an API key (it might take a few minutes for the key to activate).

Google Gemini API Key:

Go to Google AI Studio and generate an API key.

Once you have your API keys, create a file named .env.local in the root directory of your project (the same level as package.json). Add your keys to this file as follows:

VITE_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key_here
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

Important: Do not commit your .env.local file to version control (e.g., Git). It's already included in .gitignore by default for most React projects.

4. Run the Application
Start the development server:

npm run dev
# OR
yarn dev

The application should now be running in your browser, usually at http://localhost:5173 (or another port if 5173 is in use).

Usage
Search for a City:

Type the name of a city into the input field.

Click the "Search" button or press Enter.

Use Your Location:

Click the "Use My Location" button.

Your browser will ask for permission to access your location. Allow it to fetch weather data for your current position.

View Weather Information:

The "Current Weather" panel will display real-time conditions.

The "AI Suggestions" panel will provide clothing and travel advice.

The "Weather Details" grid will show more detailed parameters.

The "5-Day Forecast" panel will show future predictions.

Export Summary:

After searching for a city, click the "Export Summary" button to download a text file with all the displayed weather information and AI suggestions.

Troubleshooting
Horizontal Scrollbar / Empty Space on Right
This is a common layout issue, especially with animations. If you observe a horizontal scrollbar or unexpected empty space on the right side of the screen:

Hard Refresh: In your browser, perform a hard refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R on Windows/Linux, Cmd + Shift + R on Mac). This ensures the browser loads the latest CSS.

Restart Development Server: Stop your development server (Ctrl + C) and restart it (npm run dev or yarn dev).

Inspect Elements (Advanced):

Open your browser's Developer Tools (usually by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting "Inspect").

Go to the "Elements" tab.

Hover over elements like <body>, <div class="app-container">, <div class="clouds">, and individual <div class="cloud"> elements. Look for any highlighted box that extends beyond the visible viewport on the right. This will help pinpoint the exact element causing the overflow.

The overflow-x: hidden; property is applied to html, body, app-container, and clouds to contain content. The cloud animations use transform: translateX() with aggressive off-screen values (-200% to 200vw) to prevent them from causing overflow.

Future Enhancements
Hourly Forecast: Implement a detailed hourly forecast for the next 24-48 hours.

Weather Maps: Integrate interactive weather maps (radar, satellite, wind) using a library like Leaflet.js.

Saved Locations: Allow users to save favorite cities for quick access.

Unit Conversion: Add a toggle to switch between Celsius/Fahrenheit, m/s and mph for wind speed, etc.

Air Quality Index (AQI) & UV Index: Display additional environmental data.

User Preferences: Implement local storage to remember user preferences (e.g., last searched city, preferred units).

Themed Icons: Replace OpenWeatherMap icons with custom, more visually appealing SVG icons.
